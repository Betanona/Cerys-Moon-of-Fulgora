# Cerys

You discover Cerys, a moon of Fulgora whose ruins lie frozen under a thick layer of dry ice. As you touch down, methane ice crystals scatter into the vacuum. Asteroids wander overhead, along with a gentle solar wind under Fulgora’s magnetic influence.

Many frozen structures lie embedded in the surface. Though made of new materials, they bear the hallmarks of the Fulgorans. As you explore, it becomes apparent that without lightning, they turned to another source of power.

## Features

- Brand new gameplay:
    - Uncover ancient wrecks from multiple layers of ice and repair them by various methods.
    - Defrost your factory with a new mechanic, different to Aquilo.
    - The play area of the moon is finite. Terrain curves as you approach the moon's edge and the day-night boundary travels across the surface.
    - Solve the workings of plutonium to unlock devastating weaponry for offworld.
- Traditional mining is combined with a scrap recycling chain based on nuclear components.
- It is said that due to the solar wind, cargo pod drops to Cerys are restricted without researching a specific technology.
- Designed for maximum compatibility with zero changes to vanilla items, recipes or features.
- On first playthrough, Cerys is equal parts puzzle game and Space Age planet.

## Further notes

Cerys launched in 2024 as one of the first planet mods for Space Age.

The mod is balanced around vanilla Space Age and plays nicely with new or existing saves. It is possible to start a new game on the moon with the [Cerys Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cerys-Start) mod (which includes an optional speedrunning mode.) The difficulty is higher than most vanilla planets.

At launch, Cerys contained a port of [GotLag’s Flare Stack](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Flare%20Stack). We later assisted snouz to port the original mod to 2.0. As a result, with Cerys installed, the Flare stack technology is moved to the Cerys tech tree.

We advise caution with modded warehouses on first playthrough as these can interfere with the discovery process for some players. A minority of players find the dynamic lighting system distracting—please bear in mind this can be disabled in the mod settings.

### Localization

- English, Chinese, French, Ukrainian, Korean, Russian, Japanese.
    - To help translate more languages, submit a pull request on Github (after playing the game to get context.) Please note that some locale lines are stored in the [PlanetsLib](https://github.com/danielmartin0/PlanetsLib) Github.
